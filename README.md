# H-1B Visa Applications
This project cleans, analyses and visualises H-1B (employment-based) visa applications to the USA in the years 2014-2017. There is also a simple predictive modelling component at the end, predicting salaries and outcome of applications.

Alternatively click on the ipynb file "H-1BVisaApplications.ipynb" to see the notebook (but know that this won't render some of the 'plotly' graphs, of which there are only two anyway). 

Here's the main cool image from the work:
